All of the information on Trail Angeles is contributed by volunteers, and anyone can make a new edit. You might find some information is out of date, or there might be a trail missing, or maybe you took a great photo for a group that you'd like to upload.

## Editing the website

Our website is hosted on a site called GitHub. You will need a free GitHub account in order to sign in to our sites CMS (Content Management System), but the CMS is user friendly and you don't need to know how to code to use it.

### Step 1: Create a free GitHub account

### Step 2: Login to the CMS

You can access the CMS by visiting https://trailangeles.netlify.app/admin. Sign in using your GitHub account and then you will see something like this:

Each of these categories on the left represents content displayed on Trail Angeles. Each one is a collection of data that can be edited and saved to the site from the CMS. Here's a breakdown of what each one is:

- **Sortable Filters**: The list of filters that shows up on the Volunteer Groups page. The filters defined here can be chosen when you edit the Volunteer Groups collection, and make the filtering on the site work.
- **Places**: Specific locations that show up on the maps, with clickable icons. For example a place might be the Sam Merrill Trailhead Parking Area. The Altadena Crest Trail and the Sam Merrill Trail both share this place, so you would link both of those Trails to the same Place, and on both of those Trails individual trail maps you would see the Parking Area icon show up on the map as a clickable icon
- **Trails Data**: The list of trails. A trail
